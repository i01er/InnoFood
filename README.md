### Background
According to Hong Kong’s Environmental Protection Department, food waste contributes to over 30% of Hong Kong’s total waste, totaling over 3,400 tonnes. The Hong Kong government is currently aiming to reduce food waste disposal to landfills by at least 40% by 2022.

### Challenge
Think about how technology can be used to help reduce food waste in Hong Kong. Develop a web or mobile app, interactive game, or other technology platform that would incentivize citizens, businesses, or government to address this issue.
